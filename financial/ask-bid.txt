What is Bid(from buyer):
	The bid price represents the maximum price that a buyer or buyers are willing to pay for a security(An apple).

What is ask(taker willing to receive):
	The ask price represents the minimum price that a seller or sellers are willing to receive for the security(An apple).

When trade or transaction occur?:
	A trade or transaction occurs when the buyer and seller agree on a price for the security(An apple).


The average investor has to contend with the bid and asked spread as an implied cost of trading. For example, if the current price quotation for security A is $10.50 / $10.55, investor X who is looking to buy A at the current market price would pay $10.55, while investor Y who wishes to sell A at the current market price would receive $10.50.

The bid-ask spread works to the advantage of the market maker. Continuing with the above example, a market maker who is quoting a price of $10.50 / $10.55 for security A is indicating a willingness to buy A at $10.50 (the bid price) and sell it at $10.55 (the asked price). The spread represents the market maker's profit.
